# Backlog

## Features
- Allow the user to give a single route for a Controller#Show route, instead of hard coding every unique Resource#Show URL
  * Implementation should account for any route that allows variables/parameters in the URL
- Error reporting during CSS generation (404, 500 errors, etc.)
- Improve installation process, if possible
- Improve implementation. Is their a better solution then using Rails.cache?
